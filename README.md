# Continue

This gem was created to help with situations where a chain or pipeline of
commands are run. Where a command encounters an error it can prevent remaining commands from being run.

For example,

```ruby
  Continue::Run [
    Continue::Command() {|val| do_something_ok ? true : false },
    Continue::Command() {|val| do_something_else; true }
  ]
```

For a lower level interface, a lambda can be provided. By convention the lambda
requires three parameters, a proc to be called on success, a proc to be called
on error, and a value object that can be used for shared context between the
commands.

```ruby

  Continue::Run [
    ->(s,e,v) { do_the_first_thing ? s.call : e.call },
    ->(s,e,v) { do_the_second_thing ? s.call : e.call },
    ->(s,e,v) { do_the_third_thing ? s.call : e.call }
  ]

```

This may help replace nested if statement code that looks like,

```ruby
  if do_the_first_thing
    if do_the_second_thing
       if do_the_third_thing
         handle_success
       else
         handle_error
       end
    else
      handle_error
    end
  else
    handle_error
  end
```

## Installation
